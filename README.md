# SKOS Visualization

The `skosviz` tool is a simple program for visualising SKOS-based RDF metadata.

It requires `python` and `graphviz` to be installed. To use RDF formats other
than RDF/XML, you need the `rapper` program installed.

## License

The `skosviz` project is released under the GPL version 3 or later license.
